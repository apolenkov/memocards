## üêõ Known Issues

## üí° Notes

### Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical for production, blocking issues, security vulnerabilities
- **Medium**: Improves UX/DX, optimizations, nice-to-have features
- **Low**: Ideas, experiments, long-term improvements

### Workflow

1. Add new tasks to "Planned Tasks" section
2. Use checkboxes `- [ ]` for tracking
3. Mark as complete with [x] and remove from list
4. Keep file focused on active work only

### Categories

- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, Ansible, Docker, deployments
- **Monitoring**: Logs, metrics, alerts, observability
- **Development**: Code quality, tests, tools
- **Documentation**: Docs, guides, ADRs
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, compliance, hardening
- **Performance**: Optimization, caching, speed
