# TESTING POLICY

## CORE PRINCIPLE
**NEVER DELETE TESTS BECAUSE THEY FAIL!**

Tests fail for a reason. Fix the reason, not the test.

## WHEN TESTS FAIL
**✅ CORRECT**:
1. Investigate WHY
2. Identify root cause
3. ASK USER if external dependency needed
4. FIX the cause
5. Run tests again

**❌ WRONG**: Delete | @Disabled | Comment out

## COMMON FAILURES

### TestContainers Error
**Root Cause**: Docker not running  
**Solution**: Ask user to start Docker  
**NEVER**: Delete integration tests!

### Missing Dependencies
**Root Cause**: Feature not implemented  
**Solution**: Implement or wait  
**NEVER**: Delete tests for unimplemented features!

## EXCEPTIONS FOR DELETION
1. User explicitly requests
2. Duplicate test
3. Test for removed feature
4. Better replacement exists

**If all NO → DON'T DELETE!**
