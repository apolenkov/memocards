JavaDoc comments must follow these quality standards:

- Be concise and substantive, capturing the essence without excessive detail
- Focus on what the method/class does, not how it does it
- Include essential information: purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions
- Avoid verbose descriptions and obvious statements
- Use clear, professional English language
- Follow standard JavaDoc format and tags
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Prefer meaningful descriptions over generic ones

Examples of good JavaDoc:
- "Calculates the total price including tax for the given items"
- "Validates user input and returns sanitized data"
- "Retrieves user profile by email address"

Examples to avoid:
- "This method does something"
- "This is a getter method"
- "This method returns a value"
