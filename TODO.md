## üö´ Won't Do

- ~~Multi-region deployment~~ (not needed for MVP)
- ~~Kubernetes migration~~ (overkill for current scale)
- ~~Microservices architecture~~ (monolith works great)

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### Minor

- [ ] IDE warnings for Ansible Jinja2 expressions (doesn't affect functionality)

### Won't Fix

- Dependabot doesn't monitor Docker images (we use Jib, no Dockerfile)

## üí° Notes

### Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical for production, blocking issues, security vulnerabilities
- **Medium**: Improves UX/DX, optimizations, nice-to-have features
- **Low**: Ideas, experiments, long-term improvements

### Workflow

1. Add new tasks to "Planned Tasks" section
2. Use checkboxes `- [ ]` for tracking
3. Mark as complete with [x] and remove from list
4. Keep file focused on active work only

### Categories

- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, Ansible, Docker, deployments
- **Monitoring**: Logs, metrics, alerts, observability
- **Development**: Code quality, tests, tools
- **Documentation**: Docs, guides, ADRs
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, compliance, hardening
- **Performance**: Optimization, caching, speed

## üìä Statistics

- **Active tasks:** 5 (High priority)
- **Backlog ideas:** 15+

**How to use:**

```bash
# Add a new task
echo "- [ ] Your task here" >> TODO.md

# Mark task complete (manually in editor)
# Change [ ] to [x], then remove from file

# View active tasks
